# xFlo Logo Assets Required

Please add these files to this directory:

## Required Files:

1. **logo_transparent.webp** - Animated W mark with transparent background (WebP format)
2. **logo_transparent.gif** - Same animated W mark as GIF fallback
3. **Wordmark SVG paths** - Need to replace placeholder paths in AnimatedXfloLogo component

## Current Status:
- ✅ Animated logo component created
- ✅ WebP detection implemented
- ✅ CSS theming system ready
- ✅ Navigation integration complete
- ⚠️ Waiting for actual logo assets

## What the system provides:
- Automatic WebP/GIF fallback
- Background-aware color theming (black/white)
- Reduced motion accessibility
- Single SVG wrapper for consistent behavior
- Integration with existing navigation logic

## Next Steps:
1. Add the actual animated W files
2. Update the wordmark SVG paths in the component
3. Test with different backgrounds
4. Verify animations work correctly
